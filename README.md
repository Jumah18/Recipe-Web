CREATING A SIMPLE RECIPE WEBSITE

The website is a basic single web pag (juat the landing page), on the landing page, we have some particular dishes and there instructions.
The main feature of the website, is the availability of the search button which allows a user to input/search for a particular dish of their choice, and it gives a result showing different dishes for the particular dish searched for , it also provide more details when a particular dish is been clicked on from the result, showing a more detailed instruction about the dish, the ingredient needed and a video tutorial link for thr dish.
This was done by integrating a recipe API that helps in providing a feedback for whatever prompt is been inputed
